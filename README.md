version 0.2 (April 2019 updated)

- Used ID instead of class to find table
- Hide undesirable torrent rows completely
- Display number of rows hidden
- First row of torrents is still always shown (avoids confusion)

Reccomended:
- Change your user account settings to allow 255 (max) torrents on each page.

Happy seeding.
